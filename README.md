# Progressive Web Applications: Text Editor

![licenseShield](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-yellow)

# Description
This challenge is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.
