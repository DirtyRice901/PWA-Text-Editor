# Progressive Web Applications: Text Editor

![licenseShield](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-yellow)

# Description
This challenge is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## Installation
### The following dependencies required to run the application:

 __Rememember to ```npm init``` before installing these packages__

* [express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)

* [Webpack-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-cli)

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

* [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)



## Functionalities
### A user can do the following things with this Note Taking App:
* CRUD Operations: Users should be to create new document, read existing ones,      update their conten and delete they're no longer needed.

* Offline Support: As a PWA, the text editor should be able to function offline. Changes made while offline should be saved and then synchronized when the user goes online again.

* Sync Across Devices: Changes made on one device should be reflected on all other devices where the user has the app installed.

* Rich Text Editing: The text editor might support bold, italics, underline, hyperlinks, and other rich text features.

* Auto Save: Changes to documents should be saved automatically, so users don't lose their work.
